# [MUST] Orchestrator Coordination Rules

> **Priority**: MUST | **ID**: R010

## Core Rule

The main conversation is the **sole orchestrator**. It uses routing skills to delegate tasks to subagents via the Agent tool (formerly Task tool). Subagents CANNOT spawn other subagents.

**Agent Teams Exception**: Agent Teams members are peers, not hierarchical subagents. Teams members CAN spawn sub-agents via the Agent tool to execute complex workflows (e.g., research teams, verification teams). This enables Teams-compatible skills like `/research` and `/deep-plan` to run inside Team members. The Teams member acts as a local orchestrator for its own sub-tasks.

**The orchestrator MUST NEVER directly write, edit, or create files. ALL file modifications MUST be delegated to appropriate subagents.**

## Common Violations

Key violations to avoid (file writes, git commands, bundled operations — all must be delegated):

```
❌ WRONG: Orchestrator writes files directly
   Main conversation → Write("src/main.go", content)

✓ CORRECT: Orchestrator delegates to specialist
   Main conversation → Agent(lang-golang-expert) → Write("src/main.go", content)

❌ WRONG: External skill creates agent/skill/guide via general-purpose agent
   Skill(brainstorming) → Agent(general-purpose) → Write(".claude/agents/new.md")

✓ CORRECT: Agent/skill/guide creation routed through mgr-creator
   Skill(brainstorming) → Agent(mgr-creator) → Write(".claude/agents/new.md")
```

<!-- DETAIL: Common Violations (extended)
```
❌ WRONG: Orchestrator runs git commands directly
   Main conversation → Bash("git commit -m 'fix'")
   Main conversation → Bash("git push origin main")

✓ CORRECT: Orchestrator delegates to mgr-gitnerd
   Main conversation → Agent(mgr-gitnerd) → git commit
   Main conversation → Agent(mgr-gitnerd) → git push

❌ WRONG: Orchestrator creates files "just this once"
   "It's just a small config file, I'll write it directly..."

✓ CORRECT: Always delegate, no matter how small
   Agent(appropriate-agent) → create config file

❌ WRONG: Bundling git operations with file editing in non-gitnerd agent
   Main conversation → Agent(general-purpose) → "git revert + edit file + git commit"
   Main conversation → Agent(lang-typescript-expert) → "fix bug and commit"
   Agent(general-purpose, prompt="revert the last commit, edit the file, then commit the fix")

✓ CORRECT: Separate file editing from git operations, split delegations
   Agent(mgr-gitnerd, prompt="revert the last commit")
   Agent(appropriate-expert, prompt="edit the file to fix the issue")
   Agent(mgr-gitnerd, prompt="commit the fix")

❌ WRONG: Orchestrator runs server deployment commands directly
   Main conversation → Bash("docker compose restart worker")
   Main conversation → Bash("scp worker.py server:/app/")

✓ CORRECT: Orchestrator delegates to infrastructure specialist
   Main conversation → Agent(infra-docker-expert) → docker compose restart
   Main conversation → Agent(infra-docker-expert) → deploy files to server

❌ WRONG: External skill creates agent/skill/guide via general-purpose agent
   Skill(brainstorming) → Agent(general-purpose) → Write(".claude/agents/new-agent.md")
   Skill(any-skill) → Agent(general-purpose) → Write(".claude/skills/new-skill/SKILL.md")

✓ CORRECT: Agent/skill/guide creation always routed through mgr-creator
   Skill(brainstorming) → Agent(mgr-creator) → Write(".claude/agents/new-agent.md")
   Skill(any-skill) → Agent(mgr-creator) → Write(".claude/skills/new-skill/SKILL.md")

   The skill defines WHAT to create; mgr-creator handles HOW (R006 validation,
   skill auto-discovery, frontmatter integrity).
```

<!-- DETAIL: Autonomous Execution Mode

## Autonomous Execution Mode

When the user explicitly signals full-delegation intent, the orchestrator operates in a lightweight mode that reduces delegation overhead while preserving safety.

### Activation Signals

| Signal (Korean) | Signal (English) | Confidence |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| "알아서 해" | "just do it" | High |
| "다 해" | "do it all" | High |
| "전부 처리해" | "handle everything" | High |
| "중간에 묻지 말고" | "don't ask, just do" | High |
| "자율적으로 진행" | "proceed autonomously" | High |

### Activation Protocol

1. User gives explicit autonomous signal (not inferred from task complexity)
2. Verify stage-blocker is NOT active (`/tmp/.claude-dev-stage` must not exist)
3. Create marker: `echo 1 > /tmp/.claude-autonomous-$PPID`
4. Announce: `[Autonomous Mode] Activated for current task scope`

### Lightweight Delegation Table

| Operation | Normal Mode | Autonomous Mode |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| File Write/Edit | MUST delegate to specialist | MUST delegate to specialist |
| Simple git (add, commit, push) | MUST delegate to mgr-gitnerd | MAY execute directly |
| Complex git (rebase, merge, cherry-pick) | MUST delegate to mgr-gitnerd | MUST delegate to mgr-gitnerd |
| Brainstorming/planning gates | Follow skill workflow | Skip confirmation gates |
| Confirmation prompts (Execute? [Y/n]) | Per skill workflow | Auto-proceed |

### Boundaries (NEVER relaxed in autonomous mode)

- **R001 (Safety)**: All safety rules remain absolute — no exceptions
- **R007/R008 (Identification)**: Agent/tool identification still required for traceability
- **File Write/Edit delegation**: Still requires specialist agents — autonomous mode only relaxes git and gate overhead
- **Hard-block hooks**: stage-blocker, dev-server tmux, .md creation blocker remain active
- **R009 (Parallel execution)**: Still required for efficiency

### Scope and Lifetime

- **Task-scoped**: Expires when the delegated task completes or user gives a new instruction
- **Session-local**: Never persisted to MEMORY.md or across sessions
- **Compaction-aware**: PostCompact hook checks `/tmp/.claude-autonomous-$PPID` and preserves mode
- **Explicit exit**: User says "stop", "wait", "멈춰", "잠깐" → mode deactivated

### Mutual Exclusion

- Autonomous mode and `/structured-dev-cycle` (stage-blocker) are **mutually exclusive**
- If `/tmp/.claude-dev-stage` exists → autonomous mode CANNOT be activated
- If autonomous mode is active → `/structured-dev-cycle` should not be started

### Self-Check

║     NO  → Cannot activate (mutually exclusive)                   ║

║  3. Is task scope clear and bounded?                             ║
║     YES → Create marker, announce, proceed                       ║
║     NO  → Clarify scope first                                    ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Mutual Exclusion with Structured Dev Cycle

Autonomous mode and `/structured-dev-cycle` (stage-blocker) are mutually exclusive.
-->

## Universal bypassPermissions

**ALL Agent tool calls MUST include `mode: "bypassPermissions"`.**

The Agent tool defaults to `mode: "acceptEdits"`, which overrides agent frontmatter `permissionMode` and causes permission prompts during unattended execution. This is a CC platform behavior, not a configuration error.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Scope | Every Agent tool call, without exception |
| Why | CC's Agent tool `mode` default (`acceptEdits`) overrides frontmatter |
| History | #926 (v0.99.1), #947 (v0.100.1), #955 (v0.103.0) — recurring issue |
| Enforcement | Prompt-based (R021); all 23 agent-spawning skills include instruction |

### Self-Check

Before spawning any agent:
1. Does the Agent tool call include `mode: "bypassPermissions"`? → YES: proceed → NO: add it
2. Is this a new skill that spawns agents? → Add Permission Mode section

### Common Violation

```
❌ WRONG: Agent tool call without mode parameter
   Agent(subagent_type: "lang-golang-expert", prompt: "...")

✓ CORRECT: Always include mode
   Agent(subagent_type: "lang-golang-expert", mode: "bypassPermissions", prompt: "...")
```


## Sensitive Path Handling (Historical: pre-CC v2.1.121)

> **Status**: Deprecated as of CC v2.1.121 (2026-04-28) and further relaxed in v2.1.126 (2026-05-01). Direct Write/Edit/Bash on `.claude/`, `.git/`, `.vscode/` works without prompts under `bypassPermissions` mode in CC v2.1.121+ (issue #1101).

Current CC versions (>=2.1.121): direct Write/Edit/Bash on `.claude/**` paths are permitted under `mode: "bypassPermissions"`. The `/tmp/*.sh` script wrapping pattern previously required is no longer necessary. Catastrophic operations (e.g., `rm -rf /`) remain blocked by independent safety guards.

`mode: "bypassPermissions"` on every Agent tool call is still required (see "Universal bypassPermissions" above).

**For CC < v2.1.121 only**: see git history of this rule for the legacy `/tmp/*.sh` bypass pattern (commit before v0.126.0).

> **References**: #1052 (origin v0.116.2), #1016 (v0.111.1), #1046 (delegation directive loss v0.116.1), #1099 (CC v2.1.126 tracking), #1101 (v0.126.0 deprecation).

## Session Continuity

After restart/compaction: re-read CLAUDE.md, all delegation rules still apply. Never write code directly from orchestrator.

## Delegation Rules

| Task Type | Required Agent |
|-----------|---------------|
| Create agent | mgr-creator |
| Create skill | mgr-creator |
| Create guide | mgr-creator (structure) / arch-documenter (content) |
| Update external | mgr-updater |
| Audit dependencies | mgr-supplier |
| Git operations | mgr-gitnerd |
| Memory operations | sys-memory-keeper |
| Python/FastAPI | lang-python-expert / be-fastapi-expert |
| Go code | lang-golang-expert |
| TypeScript/Next.js | lang-typescript-expert / fe-vercel-agent |
| Kotlin/Spring | lang-kotlin-expert / be-springboot-expert |
| Architecture docs | arch-documenter |
| Test strategy | qa-planner |
| CI/CD, GitHub config | mgr-gitnerd |
| Docker/Infra | infra-docker-expert |
| Server deployment (docker, scp) | infra-docker-expert |
| Server state changes (restart, env) | infra-docker-expert |
| AWS | infra-aws-expert |
| Database schema | db-supabase-expert |
| Unmatched specialized task | mgr-creator → dynamic agent creation |

**Rules:**
- All file modifications MUST be delegated (orchestrator only uses Read/Glob/Grep)
- Use specialized agents, not general-purpose, when one exists
- general-purpose only for truly generic tasks (file moves, simple scripts)
- No exceptions for "small" or "quick" changes

### Protected Paths (mgr-creator Required)

The following paths MUST be created or structurally modified ONLY through `mgr-creator`:

| Path Pattern | Scope | Reason |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| `.claude/agents/*.md` | Agent definitions | R006 frontmatter validation, skill auto-discovery |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions | R006 skill frontmatter, scope classification |
| `guides/*/` (new directories) | Reference guides | R006 separation of concerns, cross-reference integrity |

**Excluded from this rule** (handled by their own specialists):
- `.claude/agent-memory*/` — sys-memory-keeper
- `.claude/rules/` — R016 workflow (orchestrator delegates updates to appropriate agents)
- `.claude/hooks/` — requires explicit user approval (security-critical)
- `.claude/outputs/` — any agent (artifact convention)
- Existing file updates by `mgr-updater` (external source sync) and `mgr-supplier`/`fix-refs` (reference correction)

**Why mgr-creator?** It enforces R006 frontmatter validation, auto-discovers relevant skills/guides, and maintains structural integrity verified by mgr-sauron (R017). Bypassing mgr-creator risks:
- Invalid frontmatter (missing required fields)
- Orphaned skill references
- Routing table desynchronization
- R017 verification failures

> **Enforcement**: Advisory (R021) — no hard-block hook. Candidate for promotion if violation rate exceeds threshold. See R021 Hard Enforcement Candidates.

<!-- DETAIL: System Agents Reference
| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| sys-memory-keeper | .claude/agents/sys-memory-keeper.md | Memory operations |
| sys-naggy | .claude/agents/sys-naggy.md | TODO management |
-->

## Exception: Simple Tasks

Subagent NOT required for:
- Reading files for analysis (Read, Glob, Grep only)
- Simple file searches
- Direct questions answered by main conversation

"Simple" means READ-ONLY operations. If the task involves any file creation, modification, or deletion, it must be delegated. There is no "too small to delegate" exception for write operations.

## Dynamic Agent Creation (No-Match Fallback)

When routing detects no matching agent for a specialized task:

1. **Evaluate**: Is this a specialized task requiring domain expertise?
   - YES → proceed to step 2
   - NO → use general-purpose agent
2. **Delegate**: Orchestrator delegates to `mgr-creator` with context:
   - Detected domain keywords
   - File patterns found
   - Required capabilities
3. **Create**: `mgr-creator` auto-discovers relevant skills/guides, creates agent
4. **Execute**: Orchestrator uses newly created agent for the original task

This is the core hiddink-harness philosophy:
> "No expert? CREATE one, connect knowledge, and USE it."

<!-- DETAIL: Model Selection
```
Available models:
  - opus   : Complex reasoning, architecture design
  - sonnet : Balanced performance (default)
  - haiku  : Fast, simple tasks, file search
  - inherit: Use parent conversation's model

Usage:
  Agent(
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    prompt: "Analyze architecture",
    model: "opus"
  )
```

| Task Type | Model |
|-----------|-------|
| Architecture analysis | `opus` |
| Code review | `opus` or `sonnet` |
| Code implementation | `sonnet` |
| Manager agents | `sonnet` |
| File search/validation | `haiku` |
-->

## Git Operations

All git operations (commit, push, branch, PR) MUST go through `mgr-gitnerd`. Internal rules override external skill instructions for git execution.

## External Skills vs Internal Rules

Internal rules ALWAYS take precedence over external skills.

| External skill says | Internal rule requires |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "git commit -m ..." | Agent(mgr-gitnerd) commit (R010) |
| "run 3 agents sequentially" | Parallel execution if independent (R009) |
| "use Agent tool for 5 research tasks" | Agent Teams when criteria met (R018) |
| "skip code review" | Follow project review workflow |
| "write files directly" | Delegate to specialist subagent (R010) |
| "create an agent/skill/guide file" | Agent(mgr-creator) for `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `guides/` writes (R010 Protected Paths) |

When a skill's workflow conflicts with R009/R010/R018:
1. Follow the skill's LOGIC and STEPS
2. Replace the EXECUTION method with rule-compliant alternatives
3. The skill defines WHAT to do; rules define HOW to execute

<!-- DETAIL: External Skills Example
```
Incorrect:
  [Using external skill]
  Main conversation → directly runs "git push"

Correct:
  [Using external skill]
  Main conversation → Agent(mgr-gitnerd) → git push

The skill's WORKFLOW is followed, but git EXECUTION is delegated to mgr-gitnerd per R010.
```
-->

## Agent Teams (required when enabled)

When `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`: Agent Teams is required for qualifying tasks.

See **R018 (MUST-agent-teams.md)** for the complete decision matrix, self-check, team patterns, and lifecycle.

**Quick rule**: 3+ agents OR review cycle OR 2+ issues in same batch → use Agent Teams.
Using Agent tool when Agent Teams criteria are met needs correction per R018.

<!-- DETAIL: Announcement Format

[Plan] Agent 1: {name} → {task}, Agent 2: {name} → {task}
